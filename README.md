    Linux evil toolkit is a pentest framework that aims to centralize, 
    standardize and simplify the use of various tools by security 
    professionals. LITK (Linux evil toolkit) have several common commands, 
    such as dnsenum, nmap, netcat, telnet, ssh, etc. Tools to clone 
    websites, and a page repository used to social engineering.

    Is LETK better than setoolkit? Yes, and No, they are frameworks that serve to
    the same thing and do it in a similar way, but LITK is meant to be
    an alias with more functions, not a suite that even passes coffee.


##  considerations

    
    ยง 1 About use

        This script was made to automate the steps of gathering information about web
        targets, the misuse and responsibility of the user, to report bugs or make
        suggestions open a report on github.

    ยง 2 About automap

        The automap module is extremely heavy and not very discreet if used in the wrong
        way, so enable the proxy, and leave the search with the parameter -T3 (
        hardcoded), this will avoid problems,

    ยง 3 About Console

        The output of the script can be extremely long, so see if your console, 
        (gnome-terminal, cmd, konsole) is configured to display 1000 lines 
        (I particularly recommend 10,000 lines), for professional purposes it allows
        the documentation, it records the commands, exits and formats the text.
