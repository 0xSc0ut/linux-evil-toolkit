    Linux evil toolkit is a pentest framework that aims to centralize, 
    standardize and simplify the use of various tools by security 
    professionals. LITK (Linux evil toolkit) have several common commands, 
    such as dnsenum, nmap, netcat, telnet, ssh, etc. Tools to clone 
    websites, and a page repository used to social engineering.

    Is LETK better than setoolkit? Yes, and No, they are frameworks that serve to
    the same thing and do it in a similar way, but LITK is meant to be
    an alias with more functions, not a suite that even passes coffee.
